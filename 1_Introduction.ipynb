    "### Gladier: The Globus Architecture for Data-Intensive Experimental Research.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Gladier is a programmable data capture, storage, and analysis architecture for experimental facilities. The architecture leverages a data and computing substrate based on agents deployed across computer and storage systems at APS, ALCF, and elsewhere, all managed by cloud-hosted Globus services. In particular, we leverage [Globus Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect)\r\n",
    "and [funcX](https://funcx.org) agents to facilitate secure, reliable remote data and computation and employ the [Globus Flows](https://www.globus.org/platform/services/flows) platform to orchestrate distributed data management tasks into reliable pipelines.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Gladier Toolkit\r\n",
    "The Gladier toolkit provides tools and capabilities to simplify and accelerate the development of these automations. The toolkit manages the dynamic creation of flows, automatically registers funcX functions, and assists in validating inputs. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here we demonstrate how the Gladier toolkit can be used to let anyone create a simple, yet powerful client to automate data management tasks.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "While not necessary to use this notebook, the Gladier toolkit is available on pypi and can be installed with:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "    $ pip install gladier\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Documentation is available [here.](https://gladier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\r\n"

    "Here we create a Gladier tool called `FileSize`. To do this we first define a function called `file_size`. The function is then specified as the funcx_function of the FileSize tool. The FileSize tool extends the GladierBaseTool class, providing capabilities to dynamically register the function as it changes and validate inputs when it is used within a flow."

    "Gladier Clients manage a collection of Gladier Tools and a Globus Flow to link them together into a pipeline. Clients handle both registering funcX functions for each tool and registering the flow to orchestrate each tool's execution. The checksum of the flows and funcX functions are checked prior to each invocation to ensure they are always up-to-date. Further, the client checks the necessary inputs to each tool are present before the flow is invoked.\r\n",

These values can be overridden in the flow or defined in the Tool definition.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It is important to note that the funcX function id, `file_size_funcx_id` is automatically populated by the Client at runtime.

As such, you do not need to specify the function id as input to the flow.\r\n",
